Through this repository I will share my project correlated to data visualization

### CO2 per Country
Used dataset is attached: CO2 Dataset.xlsx

It was used 'CO2 Data Cleaned' sheet.

Next, for creating a chart that displays the CO2 emissions per country: double-click on country name dimension and double-click on the measures CO2 (kt) for scaling by CO2 emissions (this changed the size of the dots to be proportional to the amount of CO2 emitted).

See attached PNG file: CO2_per_country
