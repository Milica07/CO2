# CO2
Through this repository I will share my project correlated to data visualization

### CO2
Used dataset is attached: CO2 Dataset.xlsx

It was used 'CO2 Data Cleaned' sheet.

Next, for creating a chart that displays the CO2 emissions per country: double-click on country name dimension and double-click on the measures CO2 (kt) for scaling by CO2 emissions (this changed the size of the dots to be proportional to the amount of CO2 emitted).
