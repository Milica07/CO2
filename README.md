# CO2
Through this repository I will share my project correlated to data visualization (creating and editing charts)

Tableau is a powerful, free-to-access software tool used for visualizing data.

### CO2 per Country
Used dataset is attached: CO2 Dataset.xlsx

It was used 'CO2 Data Cleaned' sheet.

##### Visualization of CO2 emissions

- Visualization in which the CO2 emissions are displayed per country


Dimensions and measures:


Double-click the Country Name dimension - will show a map of the countries on the planet with dots indicating which countries are represented in the data.

For scaling by CO2 emissions -> Double-click the measure CO2 (kt) -> This changed the size of the dots to be proportional to the amount of CO2 emitted.

See attached PNG file: CO2_per_country

### CO2 per Capita per region
Used dataset is attached: CO2 Dataset.xlsx

It was used 'CO2 Data Cleaned' sheet.

##### Visualization of CO2 per capita per region

- Visualization in which the CO2 emissions are displayed per capita per region

Dimensions and measures:

Double-click the Region dimension - will show a maps of the regions on the planet. 

For scaling CO2 per capita -> Double-click the measure CO2 Per Capita -> This changed the size of the dots to be proportional to the amount of CO2 emitted per capita.
